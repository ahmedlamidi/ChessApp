Things to consider -

Need to prioritize capturing
- The positional play should just be to resolve conflicts
- it should never be better to move to a square than to win a trade
- the values have to be less than the ratio of queen to pawn so less than 0.10
- I can try -
    bad spot - 1.00
    Decent spot - 1.05
    Good spot - 1.09
positional play

how many moves to actually get to that desired position 
- It should prioritize sooner benefits
- unless the benefit of the later one is that much better
- should also be less than a bishop
- can leave a free pawn to get better - but should still look to gain material advantage in the short term
- if the long term loss is not too much
- how to make it that it also sees for the other party 
- each decision should be a factor of how likely we are to get to that branch
- can be depth only - could also look to increase the weighting if it is one of the optimal branches found so far


the numbers should work to prioritize in this order
