Things to consider -

Need to prioritize capturing
- The positional play should just be to resolve conflicts
- it should never be better to move to a square than to win a trade
- the values have to be less than the ratio of queen to pawn so less than 0.10
- I can try -
    bad spot - 1.00
    Decent spot - 1.05
    Good spot - 1.09
positional play
how many moves to actually get to that desired position 

the numbers should work to prioritize in this order
